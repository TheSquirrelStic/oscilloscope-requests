| UPDATE (2024-11-29): ...yeah, I've been terminated from YouTube. It sucks for everyone, but when one |
| of your channels is dedicated to uploading dubbed songs from cartoons, it was bound to happen        |
| someday. I am currently working to get all of my channels back up, but I can't guarantee anything.   |
| Until then, requests I've finished will be preceded by a group of asterisks.                         |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

For the most part, these requests are listed in order of when they were made. However, if you have
made a substantial number of requests in a row, other people's requests may be interspersed among
yours in order to give everyone a chance to have their requests done.

Also, keep in mind I am only doing DS, SNES, and GBA requests for the time being. So if your request
is not here, it is probably because it is for a different console than the three mentioned.
