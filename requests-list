@flamingphoenix1425
New Super Mario Bros. Minigames
Danger, Bob-omb! Danger!
(some of the notes are inexplicably dropped at random when playing this song in VG Music Studio, so I will wait until further notice to do this one)

@さいかゆうき-y6k
Mario's Super Picross
(game request)
(seems like all of the tracks do something similar to dynamic channel allocation, so it will be a nightmare to deconstruct this game)

@JordanCurrie-st8ej
Super Mario Advance
Fanfares and Jingles
(tbh I kinda wanna wait until the rest of the songs are deconstructed before doing the fanfares and jingles)

@BirdKeeperAle
Super Mario All-Stars
Super Mario Bros. 3 Fortress
(gonna hold off on this one for a bit until I determine how I want to deconstruct it)

@JeremyCardinal-tf5mn
Pokémon Stadium
P97+98 Cup Battle 4-6
(postponed until further notice due to numerous difficulties as well as my complete lack of experience in deconstructing N64 games)
