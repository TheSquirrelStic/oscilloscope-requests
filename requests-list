| UPDATE (2025-07-12): I am now back on YouTube! However, requests will be temporarily closed until I |
| get all my deconstructions up on the site, which, since I don't have advanced features and thus can |
| only upload a maximum of 10 videos per day, means they won't be open until August 6.                |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

For the most part, these requests are listed in order of when they were made. However, if you have
made a substantial number of requests in a row, other people's requests may be interspersed among
yours in order to give everyone a chance to have their requests done.

Also, keep in mind I am only doing DS, SNES, and GBA requests for the time being. So if your request
is not here, it is probably because it is for a different console than the three mentioned.
